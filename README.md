# n8n Mail Labeler Workflow

This n8n workflow automatically classifies and labels incoming E-Mail messages based on their content, subject, and sender. 

It uses a text classifier node with custom categories such as 
**Advertisement, Jobs, Work, Receipt, and Unknown.** 

Each email is analyzed and, depending on its classification, the appropriate E-Mail label is applied. The workflow leverages AI-powered classification and is designed to help users organize their inbox efficiently by automating the labeling process for different types of emails.
